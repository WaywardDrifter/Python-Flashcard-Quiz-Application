    "# Python Flashcard Quiz Application\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive flashcard quiz application helps you review Python programming concepts from the Codecademy Python 3 course. Run the code cell below to start the quiz and see questions in the output area!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "- Run the code cell by clicking it and pressing `Shift+Enter`.\n",
    "- The quiz will ask 5 random questions from 45 flashcards, one at a time (e.g., \"Category: Basics\" and \"Question: What is a variable?\").\n",
    "- For each question, type your answer at the prompt (\"Your answer (or type 'hint' for a hint):\") and press Enter.\n",
    "- Type \"hint\" to see a hint for the question (if available), then answer again.\n",
    "- You'll get feedback (\"Correct!\" or \"Incorrect...\") per question and a final score (e.g., \"4/5 (80.0%)\").\n",
    "- All questions are formatted clearly (e.g., \"What is a list?\" or \"What does print() do?\").\n",
    "- **Study Tip**: Write down any questions you miss to review those concepts later. If a question feels unclear, note it for adding hints or examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- 45 flashcards organized into 7 subcategories: Basics, Data Structures, Control Flow, Functions, Modules, Data Science, and Advanced.\n",
    "- Random question selection with no repeats within a quiz.\n",
    "- Flexible answer-checking accepting partial answers (e.g., \"mutable\" for \"What is a list?\").\n",
    "- Hint system for selected questions (currently 5 hints) to aid learning without reducing challenge.\n",
    "- Score tracking with percentage display.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planned Features\n",
    "- Expand the number of hints to cover more questions, enhancing clarity for complex concepts.\n",
    "- Increase the number of flashcards to include additional Python topics and deepen coverage.\n",
    "- Category-specific quizzes to focus on specific topics (e.g., Functions only).\n",
    "- Review mode for missed questions to reinforce weak areas.\n",
    "- Customizable question count for flexible study sessions.\n",
    "- Progress tracking to save scores and monitor improvement over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics Covered\n",
    "- Fully covers the Codecademy Python 3 course, including variables, data structures, loops, functions, modules, exceptions, and data science libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The code is visible in this notebook for learning purposes. To share a polished version showing only questions and answers, export as HTML (File > Download as > HTML) or PDF (File > Print Preview > Save as PDF). This project is actively maintained, with planned enhancements to expand content and functionality."
